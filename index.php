						<p><strong>To My Godparents, TEST</strong></p><p>Matt</p>

						<p>Here we are again!  Another year in the books, another Christmas Season upon us, and another chance for me to take some time to reflect.</p>

						<!--
						<p>Before I start, I want you to know that I am very thankful to have so many inspriing people in my life to look up to.  I want to take a quick minute to let you both know how you've impacted my life:</p>

						<p>Aunt Kathy: the mother and grandmother that you have proven to be.  I know that it is not easy being so far away from ones that you love, yet you constantly find the time and energy to be seemingly everywhere at once.  The way that you put everybody else's needs before your own. 

						<p>Uncle David: it's very easy to see that you have a such a positive impact on so many people.  So many people that see you as apart of their family, because of how kind, funny and loving that you are &mdash; to everybody.  You seem to have friend's all over the world, and I know that's because 
					
						<p>I'm greatful to have influences like you both in my life, and I do not take that for granted.</p>
						-->


						<p><strong><u>Maci</u></strong></p>
						<p>This has been another exciting year for Maci.  She has lost a total of 4 teeth this year (with a 5th very wobbly as we speak).  She started 1st grade this year and has continued to excel in school (reading at a 4th grade level!).  Her teacher(s) also have nothing but really good things to say about her.  She's a great student, with a big thirst for knowledge. </p>

						<p>Maci's also involved in a lot of extra curricular activities.  A normal week includes gymnastics, swimming and soccer.  At the beginning of the year, I would've said soccer was her favorite sport, however as she has progressed, she has really fell in love with gymnastics.  She still loves to play board games, and is extremely competitive.</p>

						<p><strong><u>Lillian</u></strong></p>
						<p>Lillian has had a very good year this year!  She turned 5 in May, and started Kindergarten at Middlebranch (same school as Maci).  It was a little adjustment going from Westbrook (Aunt Cynthia's school) a few days a week, to being in Kindergarten all day for 5 days a week, but Lillian has loved it.  Her favorite subject is Music.</p>

						<p>She also has made a lot of new friends this year (even though she is still our shy Lily).  She loves taking ballet lessons and also enjoys playing Soccer in the spring and fall (her and Maci weren't on the same team last season, either - so it was nice to see her not be so dependant on her big sister).  Her favorite things to do at home are to dance and do her own hair.</p>

						<p><strong><u>Jess</u></strong></p>
						<p>What can I say about Jess that I haven't already.  She continues to be the glue that keeps this family moving.  She was little worried about coming into this year &mdash; worried that both of her children would be going off to school all day, and that she wouldn't be able to function without them home.  However, she has been able to finally get a few minutes each day to focus on herself, which has had a profound difference in her self-esteem and confidence.</p>

						<p>Jess continues to be a whiz in the kitchen.  Continually finding new recipes that are not only delicious, Gluten Free, but also budget friendly ;)  She has become a pretty good "couponer" and has found the best grocery stores for specific items (you don't dare buy fruit at Gient Eagle, or meat at Aldi's).  I envy her organization skills, because without them our entire family would be completely disorganized!</p>

						<p>When she's not cooking, cleaning, runs our errands or picking up kids, she enjoys a glass of red wine, crafting and decorating the house. Her favorite day is Friday, when the entire family spends the evening eating pizza in the living room and watching Full House (the old versions - the girls love it!), reminding us both of our own childhoods.</p>

						<p><strong><u>Me</u></strong></p>
						<p>This has been another up and down year for me.  It started with rumors at work that we were getting acquired by another company.  In June, those rumors became a reality, and about 75% of the workforce was cut.  I am now employed by a company called Blue Star Sports, which has spent the last 18 months acquiring other companies in the sports/tech industry.</p>

						<p>When STACK was acquired by Blue Star Sports, I went from working from home 3 days per week, to working from home full-time (which I LOVE).  Things have been going great so far.  As of now, I am in charge of managing both the stack.com and bluestarsports.com websites, as well as managing our digital advertising across the entire network (i.e. the banner ads you see on the websites).  Blue Star Sports is trying to become more organized and structured (a necessity after acquiring nearly 20 companies in 2 years) and I am excited for what the future has to bring.</p>

						<p>Having the flexibility of working from home has also allowed me to continue exploring my newly found love for Electrical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.  I was able to combine both passions earlier this year when I built a system that was able to detect household objects (see picture below).  My more recent AI projects are based around "self learning" AI - meaning that the machine continually retrains itself based on past experiences.</p>

						<p><center><img class="img-responsive" src="img/AI.jpeg"/></center></p>

						<p>I've also been working on creating "Alexa Skills".  These are basically apps for the Amazon Alexa devices.  Some of my skills have become so popular that Amazon has actually started paying me for some of them (as well as sending a bunch of cool SWAG).  I'm still waiting on my billion dollar idea, but I believe that everything that I've been learning is getting me one step closer.</p>

						<p>Last but not least, I wanted to also <a href="photos.php">share some pictures</a> from throughout the year. I am not good at keeping up with Social Media, so a lot of these have never been seen ;)</p>

						<p>I love you both, and Merry Christmas!</p>

						<p><strong>Matt</strong></p>
