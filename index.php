						<p><strong>Dear Godparents,</strong></p>

						<p>Another year, another letter.  I do hope that you both enjoy receiving this gift as much as I enjoy writing it.  </p>

						<p><strong><u>Maci</u></strong></p>
						<p>Maci has had an exciting year in 2016</p>

						<p><strong><u>Lillian</u></strong></p>

						<p>Lillian's year had a rough start.  She started it off by breaking her collar bone (she was jumping on our chaise lounge and took an ackward tumble).</p>

						<p><strong><u>Jess</u></strong></p>
						<p>Jess' uear has been more of the same</p>

						<p><strong><u>Me</u></strong></p>
						<p>This has been a rollar coaster of a year for me.  </p>
